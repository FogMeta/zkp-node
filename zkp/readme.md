# Zero-Knowledge Proofs with gnark

## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step tutorial on implementing zero-knowledge proofs using the `gnark` library in Go. We'll be walking through a simple example of proving and verifying a cubic equation without revealing the specific values involved.

## Prerequisites

- Go programming language
- Basic understanding of zero-knowledge proofs
- `gnark` library installed

## Implementing a Zero-Knowledge Proof

We will create a simple program that demonstrates how a prover can convince a verifier that they know the solution to a cubic equation without revealing the actual numbers involved.

### Step 1: Import Necessary Packages

The first step is to import the `gnark`, `gnark-crypto`, `backend`, and `frontend` packages. These packages provide the tools needed to create and verify zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge).

### Step 2: Define the Circuit

We define a `CubicCircuit` struct that represents the cubic equation \(x^3 + x + 5 = y\). The struct has two fields `X` and `Y`, representing the variables in our equation.

### Step 3: Define Constraints

Next, we declare the constraints of the circuit in the `Define` method. We use the `api` parameter to create and assert constraints.

### Step 4: Compile the Circuit

The `frontend.Compile` function compiles the circuit into a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS), preparing it for the generation of proofs.

### Step 5: Setup Groth16 zk-SNARK

The `groth16.Setup` function is used to set up the proving and verification keys for the zk-SNARK.

### Step 6: Define the Witness

A witness is an assignment of values to the circuit variables that satisfy its constraints. We create a witness that aligns with our cubic equation.

### Step 7: Generate the Proof

We use the `groth16.Prove` function to create a zk-SNARK proof. This proof can be verified by anyone who has the verification key, proving the witness satisfies the circuit’s constraints without revealing the witness itself.

### Step 8: Verify the Proof

The `groth16.Verify` function checks the validity of the proof. A successful verification confirms the existence of a witness that satisfies the circuit’s constraints.
